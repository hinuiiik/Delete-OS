# Delete-OS
Deleting your Operating System (Windows and Linux)


This probably doesn't work, I dont care. Make a PR if you want to. 

# Running On Linux
Download repository, cd to the directory, and run `sudo ./delete.sh`. If it doesn't work, throw your computer out of a window for the same effect. 

# Running On Windows
Download repository, right click on bat file and run as administrator. If this doesn't work then contact your local police department right away.
